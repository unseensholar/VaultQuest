# VaultQuest - Obsidian Gamification Plugin 🎮✨📜

VaultQuest is an Obsidian plugin that gamifies your note-taking experience by awarding XP and points for writing and completing tasks. Earn XP as you type, level up, and track your progress. 🏆📝🚀

## Why? 🤔
A long time back, I worked on a project to 'gamify' a Discord server with XP gain, text-based battles, and a whole RPG-like system with skills, items, shops, hidden channels, and quests. I had a blast designing the lore and mechanics back then, but trying to get it running again on Discord was tiring.

Since I use Obsidian every day, I tried some of the gamification plugins, but nothing really scratched the itch. So, I figured I’d repurpose my old scripts for something I’d actually use, for myself and anyone else who’d enjoy it.

Now, VaultQuest includes an XP system, reward points, a skill system, and an AI-powered task evaluator. The AI entity determines task difficulty, assigns points, and allows users to spend points for custom AI-generated responses.
